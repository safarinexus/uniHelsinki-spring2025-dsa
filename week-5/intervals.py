'''
You are given a list of intervals, and your task is to count how many of the intervals are nested inside another interval.
An interval (a,b) consists of the integers a,a+1,...,b. For example, the interval (3,7) consists of the integers 3,4,5,6,7.
An interval (a_1,b_1) is nested inside an interval (a_2,b_2) if a_2 ≤ a_1 and b_1 ≤ b_2.
For example, the intervals (4,6), (3,4) and (5,7) are all nested inside the interval (3,7).
For example, for the list [(3,7),(1,2),(2,8),(1,4)] the desired answer is 2, because the intervals (3,7) and (1,2) are nested inside another interval.
The interval (3,7) is nested inside the interval (2,8), and the interval (1,2) is nested inside the interval (1,4).
In a file intervals.py, implement the function count_nested that takes a list of intervals as a parameter and returns the number of nested intervals.
You may assume that no two intervals on the list are the same.
You should implement the function so that it runs efficiently even for long lists.
The function should finish immediately in the last two test cases of the code template too.
