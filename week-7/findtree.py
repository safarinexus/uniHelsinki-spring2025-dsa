'''
You are given a grid that contains a description of a tree. 
Your task is to reconstruct the described tree.
The grid can contain the following symbols:

.: an empty square
1â€“9: a node of the tree
/: a connection down and left
|: a connection straight down
\: a connection down and right

Each node has at most three children.
Between a node and its child are one or more connection symbols.
The connections are straight lines without bends.
If a node has one child, it is straight down. 
If a node has two children, they are down and left and down and right. 
If a node has three children, they are down and left, straight down, and down and right.
In a file findtree.py, implement the function find_tree whose parameter is a description of the grid as a list of strings. 
The function returns the structure of the depicted tree using the class Node.
You may assume that the size of the grid is at most 20 x 20 and that the grid depicts a tree with at least one node.

Here r"" denotes a string in which the character \ is not treated as an escape character but as a regular character.
