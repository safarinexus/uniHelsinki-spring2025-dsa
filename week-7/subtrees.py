'''
Your task is to build a list that contains the subtree sizes for all the nodes in a tree from the smallest to the largest.
For example, in the tree below, the desired list is [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7].
The tree has four leaves with a subtree size of 1. 
The node 2 has a subtree of size 2, the node 4 has a subtree of size 3, and the node 1 has a subtree of size 7.

In a file subtrees.py, implement the function count_subtrees that takes a reference to the root of a tree as parameter and returns the list of subtree sizes.
