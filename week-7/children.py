'''
Your task is to build a list that contains the child counts of all the nodes in a tree from the smallest to the largest.
For example, in the tree below, the desired list is [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3]. 
The tree has four nodes that have no children. The node 2 has one child, the node 4 has two children, and the node 1 has three children.

In a file children.py, implement the function count_children that takes a reference to the root of a tree as parameter and returns the list of child counts.
