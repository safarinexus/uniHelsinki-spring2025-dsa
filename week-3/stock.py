'''
You are given the price of a stock during a period of n days. 
You can buy the stock on any day and sell the stock on the same day or any later day.
Your task is to compute for each day the highest profit you could have achieved by selling the stock on that day.
For example, when the prices are [3,2,3,5,1,4], the desired answer is the list [0,0,1,3,0,3]. 
For example, on the fourth day the maximum profit is 3, because you could have bought the stock at the price 2 and sold it at the price 5.
In a file stock.py, implement the function find_profits that takes a list of prices as a parameter, and returns the list of profits.
You must implement an efficient solution with a time complexity O(n). 
For example, you cannot afford to go through all possible buying days for each selling day. 
Your solution should determine each profit more efficiently.
In the last test case of the following code template, the stock prices are [1,2,...,10^5]. 
Your function should finish quickly in this test case too.
