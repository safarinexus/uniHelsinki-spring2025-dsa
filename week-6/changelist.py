'''
Your task is to implement a class that maintains a list of numbers and has a method for efficiently incrementing all elements of the list by a given amount.
In a file changelist.py, implement the class ChangeList with the following methods:

append(number): add number to the end of the list
get(index): access a number on the list
change_all(amount): increment all list numbers by amount

In the method change_all, the parameter amount can be negative too, in which case all numbers are decremented. All methods should work in O(1) time.

Here the numbers 1, 2 and 3 are first added to the list, after which the list contents are [1,2,3]. Then all numbers are incremented by 2, after which the list contents are [3,4,5]. Finally, the number 8 is added to the list and all numbers are changed by -1, after which the list contents are [2,3,4,7].
You can test the efficiency of your solution with the following code. In this case too the code should finish almost immediately.

class ChangeList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.numList = {}
        self.change = 0
        self.index = 0

    def append(self, number):
        self.numList[self.index] = number - self.change
        self.index += 1

    def get(self, index):
        return self.numList[index] + self.change


    def change_all(self, amount):
        self.change += amount
        

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = ChangeList()

    numbers.append(1)
    numbers.append(2)
    numbers.append(3)

    print(numbers.get(0)) # 1
    print(numbers.get(1)) # 2

    numbers.change_all(-1)
    print(numbers.get(0)) # 2
    print(numbers.get(1)) # 3
    print(numbers.get(2)) # 4
    print(numbers.get(3)) # 7

    numbers = ChangeList()
    total = 0
    for i in range(10**5):
        numbers.append(i + 1)
        numbers.change_all(i % 11 - 5)
        total += numbers.get(i // 2)
    print(total) # 2500049970
