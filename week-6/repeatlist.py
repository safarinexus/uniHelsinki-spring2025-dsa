'''
Your task is to implement a class that maintains a list of numbers and has an efficient method that reports if some number occurs more than once on the list.
In a file repeatlist.py, implement the class RepeatList with the following methods:

append(number): add a number to the end of the list
repeat(): return True if some number repeats on the list, otherwise return False

Both methods should work in O(1) time

Here the numbers 1, 2 and 3 are first added to the list so that the list content is [1,2,3] and there is no repeating number.
Then the number 2 is added to the list resulting in the content [1,2,3,2] with a repeat of the number 2. 
Finally, the number 5 is added resulting in the content [1,2,3,2,5] with the number 2 still repeating.
You can test the efficiency of your solution with the following code. In this case too the code should finish almost immediately.

class RepeatList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.track = {}
        self.res = False

    def append(self, number):
        if number in self.track: 
            self.res = True
        else: 
            self.track[number] = 1

    def repeat(self):
        return self.res

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = RepeatList()

    print(numbers.repeat()) # False

    numbers.append(1)
    numbers.append(2)
    numbers.append(3)
    print(numbers.repeat()) # False

    numbers.append(2)
    print(numbers.repeat()) # True

    numbers.append(5)
    print(numbers.repeat()) # True

    numbers = RepeatList()
    total = 0
    for i in range(10**5):
        numbers.append(i * 999983 % 12345)
        if numbers.repeat():
            total += 1
    print(total) # 87655
