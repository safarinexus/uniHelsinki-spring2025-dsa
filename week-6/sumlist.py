'''
Your task is to implement a class that maintains a list of numbers  and has a method that efficiently computes the sum of the numbers in a given sublist.
In a file sumlist.py, implement the class SumList with the following methods:

append(number): add number to the end of the list
sum(a, b): return the sum of the numbers from the position a to the position b

Both methods should work in O(1) time.

Here the list content is first set to [1,2,3,4,5] and then the following sublist sums are computed:

[1,2,3,4,5]: sum 15
[2]: sum 2
[2,3,4]: sum 9
[3,4]: sum 7
[1,2,3,4]: sum 10

Then the number 1 is added to the end of the list and the following sublist sums are computed:

[1,2,3,4,5,1]: sum 16
[1]: sum 1

You can test the efficiency of your solution with the following code. In this case too the code should finish almost immediately.

class SumList:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def append(self, number):
        pass

    def sum(self, a, b):
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = SumList()

    numbers.append(1)
    numbers.append(2)
    numbers.append(3)
    numbers.append(4)
    numbers.append(5)

    print(numbers.sum(0, 4)) # 15
    print(numbers.sum(1, 1)) # 2
    print(numbers.sum(1, 3)) # 9
    print(numbers.sum(2, 3)) # 7
    print(numbers.sum(0, 3)) # 10

    numbers.append(1)
    print(numbers.sum(0, 5)) # 16
    print(numbers.sum(5, 5)) # 1

    numbers = SumList()
    total = 0
    for i in range(10**5):
        numbers.append(i + 1)
        total += numbers.sum(i // 2, i)
    print(total) # 125005000050000
