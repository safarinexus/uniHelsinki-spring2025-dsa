'''
A list is a permutation if it contains the numbers 1,2,\dots,n exactly once each. For example, the lists [1], [2,1] and [3,1,2,4] are permutations.
In a file permutation.py, implement the class PermutationTracker with the following methods:

append(number): add number to the end of the list
check(): return True, if the list is a permutation, and False otherwise

The time complexity of both methods should be O(1).

Here the contents of the list change as follows:

[1] (is a permutation)
[1,4] (is not a permutation)
[1,4,2] (is not a permutation)
[1,4,2,3] (is a permutation)
[1,4,2,3,2] (is not a permutation)
[1,4,2,3,2,5] (is not a permutation)

You can test the efficiency of your solution using the following code. In this case too the code should finish almost immediately.
