Implement a test using Python deque, where the numbers 1,2,...,n are added to the end of the deque one at a time.
Then the first element of the deque is removed n times.
Perform the test for n=10^5. Measure two times: the time for adding the elements to the deque, and the time for removing the elements from the deque.
In this task, you get a point automatically, when you report your results and the code you used, and press the submit button.
