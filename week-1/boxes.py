'''
Your task is to pack products into boxes. A given maximum number of products fits in each box. How many boxes is needed at least?
For example, if there are 10 products and 3 products fit in a box, you need 4 boxes. For instance, you could pack 3, 3, 2 and 2 products into the boxes.
In a file boxes.py, implement the function min_count that returns the smallest number of boxes needed. The parameters of the function are:

product_count: the total number of products
box_size: the number of products that fits in one box

Your function will be tested using a large number of test cases. In each test case, both parameters are integers in the range 1–100.

    leftover = product_count % box_size 
    if leftover == 0:
        return product_count // box_size
    else:
        return round(product_count // box_size) + 1
